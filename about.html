                Founded in 2016, the Bionic Warriors are a team of students from Watkins Memorial High School. This team offers opportunities to underrepresented students to learn STEAM skills 
                that help to compete in a First Robotics Competition (FRC) guided by the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) curriculum. Leading up to 
                the competition, the Bionic Warrior team will learn technical skills to problem-solve using science, technology, engineering, and math concepts to design, build, 
                and program a robot to successfully compete. <br><br>
                Throughout each school year, the Bionic Warriors will engage others both inside the school and out in the community to 
                build awareness of the STEAM education opportunities in our school and provide a source of local pride and achievement. Members of the Bionic Warriors team will 
                grow in their own learning of STEAM concepts, necessary workplace skills, and will experience problem-solving success and failure. This total experience will prepare
                 them for their future academics and professional careers.
